This app was designed for college students who run on-campus organizations and host social events. To simplify the hassle of micromanaging drivers and passengers, I developed a drag-and-drop interface with CRUD functionalities. This repository holds all the front-end logic. This app is a large project, and many more features are planned or in-progress.   

 Users can add, edit, and delete driver information using clickable buttons on-screen. Quick edits can be made by clicking the names of drivers and passengers. Passengers can be moved by dragging and dropping them. 

- Designed, developed, and deployed the entire app using React.js and SCSS 
-	Managed shared state across several components by using the React Context API  
-	Developed several reusable components by using custom hooks and props 
-	Designed drag and drop features by working with the React-Beautiful-DnD API 
- Configured environment variables for development and production using the dotenv package
